# about-me
Week 1 About Me project for Code 201.

I created this page as a project in learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In order for it to be more fun and interactive it includes prompted questions asked of the user. 

- Five questions asking the user for a yes/no answer.
- One question asking the user to guess a number and giving four tries.
- One question asking the user to guess a country that is part of a list of countries, and giving six tries.

I used the Meyer CSS reset.
